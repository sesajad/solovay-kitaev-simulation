# Solovay-Kitaev simulation
A visualization and numerical analysis on solovay-kitaev theorem

## Report
[Here](report/report.pdf) is a report that tries to visualize and numerically show what the theorem says.

## Codes
### Sphere Visualization
[Here](code/c++) is a high performance visualization of generated SU(2) gates (mapped into a sphere) in different depths from elementary set.
(The generated sphere pictures in the report are from this code)

### Error measurement
[Here](code/julia) and [here](code/python) together make a violin plot with a line fitted on it, shows that logarithm of the average error is a linear function of n.
